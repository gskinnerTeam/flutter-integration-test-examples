# flutter_integration_test_examples

A basic example of using the new integration_test API.

A companion repo for this blog post: https://blog.gskinner.com/archives/2021/06/flutter-a-deep-dive-into-integration_test-library.html

To run the tests: `flutter test -d windows integration_test/smoke_test.dart`, replacing `windows` with your platform of choice.
